<h3>Lab classes</h3>
<p>Before beginning the lab classes, you need to install JOGL - see settingsForJOGL.html in week2to4LabClasses.zip for details. (I assume Java has already been installed on the system you are using.)

<li>No lab class in week 1.</li>
<li>Week 2: Transformations</li>
<li>Week 3: Triangles and data structures</li>
<li>Week 3: Lighting in OpenGL</li>
</ul>
<p>The material for the lab classes in weeks 1 to 4 is in week2to4LabClasses.zip below.
