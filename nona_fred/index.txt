<h2>Second World War Book</h2>
<p>Fred Lawrence was in the Royal Engineers between 1942 and 1946. He
wrote a book about his experiences which can be summarised as an
ordinary man's experiences of the Second World War. You can see his
book <a href="../granddad/granddads_book.pdf">here</a>. It is in pdf
format. The copyright of this book remains with the author.<p>
Recently Garth donated a copy of the book to the Imperial War Museum
in London.  This is the letter he received from their
archivist.<p align="center">
